# Big Data Processing
This project was developed in multiple technologies to process air quality data about every USA state. The dataset used contained daily information of all of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitors and an auxiliary dataset containing the geographical coordinates for each of the US states (latitude and longitude). Its goal was to process the data in order to answer some queries and finally reach a conclusion on the differences between them. 


This was done using:
- Map Reduce
- Spark (vanilla, using only tuples)
- Spark Dataframe
- Spark SQL
- Hive

The queries made with each of the technologies were:
- Which states have more/less monitors?
- Which counties have the best/worst air quality?
- Which states have the best/worst air quality in
each year?
- For each state, what is the average distance (in
km) of the monitors in that state to the state center?
- How many sensors there are per quadrant (NW,
NE, SE, SW) in each state?
